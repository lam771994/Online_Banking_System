*The explanation of the source codes, input & output can be found in this repository - Online_Banking_System

## Objective

The objective of this assignment is to design and develop an effective online banking system that permits the bank’s administrator to create a new profile for the customer and manage all the customers’ transactions efficiently. Meanwhile, the design of the system also allows the customers to access the system and make their own transactions like deposit and withdraw money as well as to view their own transactions.

The design of the online banking system is categorised into three parts: the admin, the
customer and the system activation. In the admin part, the functions of administor’s tasks such as create new customer’s profile, view and search customer profile, and view all transactions of a specific customer will be created. Subsequently, the customer part includes the functions of how a customer could login to the system, make transactions and view their own transactions. Lastly, the online banking system will be activated along with the admin and customer functions created. The system will be developed using Python programming language. The structure of this assignment will include the design of the system using pseudocodes and flowcharts, the program source code and its explanation, and the input and output of the created system.
